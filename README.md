# Use-I2C-LCD-to-make-some-fun-things----Electric-Memo-Pad
Since normal paper memo is not that attractive for me, I always forgot to check the reminders on it before I went to school and forgot something I had to do/ bring. I tried some alternative solutions before, such as smartphone memos. However, this memo is not a "real thing", sometimes I still forgot to check it out. So I decided to make an LCD e-memo.

Originally I wanted to use the rotary encoder for the input of letters. But it was broken (It was bought with a kit set in Aliexpress). So I need to control the cursor and the letter selection system with the same joystick. (Fun Fact: The joystick was bought with the same kit set with the rotary encoder. It was out of order a few days later after the rotary encoder. What bad luck!!)

Here is the video of the memo before the death of the joystick

Lastly,
Rip Mr Joystick and Mr Rotary Encorder
